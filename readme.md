# Protein Evolution

This repository contains code that pertains to experiments around the evolution of proteins and Genotype-Phenotype maps. This work is under the aegis of the laboratory of Ard Louis. 

## esm_experiments:
This directory contains code that is interested in successive maps using ESM invese and ESM Fold. The core question: What do the "preimages" of protein structures look like, and how can we interpret that? Does this have implications about evolution?
